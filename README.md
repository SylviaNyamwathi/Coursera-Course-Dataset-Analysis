## Objectives:
- Perform basic data exploration (EDA) on the dataset.
- Identify patterns and trends in course ratings, enrollment numbers, and course difficulty.
- Visualize data using Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly.
- Apply filtering and data querying techniques to uncover insights.

## Techniques Used:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Outlier detection
- Data filtering and aggregation
- Data visualization with charts and plots

## Tools:
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly

## Results:
- Identified top-rated and highly-enrolled courses.
- Explored relationships between course difficulty and popularity.
- Visualized key insights to support data-driven recommendations.
